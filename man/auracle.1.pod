auracle - an AUR client with a focus on flexibility

=head1 SYNOPSIS

I<auracle> [OPTIONS...] COMMAND [ARGS...]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

auracle is a tool for querying information stored by the Arch User Repository
(AUR). Invoking auracle consists of supplying an operation, any applicable
options, and usually one or more arguments.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<--color=>

Control colored output. Argument must be one of I<auto>, I<never>, or
I<always>. When set to I<auto>, color will be enabled if stdout is connected
to a terminal.

This option defaults to I<auto>.

=item B<--connect-timeout=>

Pass an integer to specify a connection timeout, in seconds, for each
connection made to the AUR. A singled failed connection will result in the
entire operation failing. If zero, there will be no connection timeout.

This option defaults to 0 (no timeout).

=item B<-h>, B<--help>

Print a short help text and exit.

=item B<--literal>

When used with the B<search> command, interpret all search terms as literal,
rather than as regular expressions.

=item B<--max-connections=>I<N>

Pass an integer value to limit the number of simultaneous connections to the
AUR backend. If zero, there will be no connection limit.

This option defaults to 0 (no limit).

=item B<--quiet>

When used with the B<search> and B<sync> commands, output will be limited to
package names only.

=item B<-r>, B<--recurse>

When used with the B<download> command, recursively follow and download
dependencies of each given argument.

=item B<--searchby=>I<BY>

When used with the B<search> and B<rawsearch> commands, change the search
dimension. I<BY> must be one of I<name>, I<name-desc>, I<maintainer>,
I<depends>, I<makedepends>, I<optdepends>, or I<checkdepends>.

This option defaults to I<name-desc>.

=item B<--sort=>I<KEY>, B<--sort=>I<KEY>

For search and info queries, sorts the results in ascending and descending
order, respectively. I<KEY> must be one of: B<name>, B<popularity>, B<votes>,
B<firstsubmitted>, or B<lastmodified>.

This option defaults to sorting by B<name> in ascending order.

=item B<-C >I<DIR>, B<--chdir=>I<DIR>

Change directory to I<DIR> before downloading and extracting tarballs.

=head1 COMMANDS

=over 4

=item B<buildorder> I<PACKAGES>...

Pass one to many arguments to print a build order for the given packages.
The resulting output will be the total ordering to build all packages.

=item B<clone> I<PACKAGES>...

Pass one to many arguments to clone package git repositories. Use the
B<--recurse> flag to clone dependencies of packages. If the git repository
already exists, the repository will instead be updated via a fast-forward only
git pull .

=item B<download> I<PACKAGES>...

Pass one to many arguments to download packages. Use the B<--recurse> flag
to download dependencies of packages.

=item B<info> I<PACKAGES>...

Pass one to many arguments to perform an info query.

=item B<pkgbuild> I<PACKAGES>...

Pass one to many arguments to print the PKGBUILDs for the given packages.

=item B<rawinfo> I<PACKAGES>...

Dump the raw JSON response from the AUR for an info request.

=item B<rawsearch> I<TERMS>...

Dump the raw JSON response from the AUR for search requests formed from the
given terms.

=item B<search> I<TERMS>...

Pass one to many arguments to perform a search query. Results will be the
intersection of all terms. Terms may be a regular expression as described by
the POSIX extended regex specification.

B<NOTE>: the AUR does not actually support searching by regular expressions
and support in auracle is implemented on a best-effort basis.

=item B<sync> [I<PACKAGES>...]

Pass one to many arguments to check for newer versions existing in the AUR.
Each argument is assumed to be a package installed locally using B<pacman>(8).
If no arguments are given, pacman is queried for all foreign packages as an
input to this operation.
